    <h1>Mega-question</h1>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/russmaxdesign/mega-question">Github Page</a></p>
    <p>Within a form, can an overall question be programmatically associated with a series of form controls and their labels below? These test pages demonstrate three different methods.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="example1.html">Example 1: Using aria-describedby</a></li>
      <li><a href="example2.html">Example 2: Using nested fieldsets</a></li>
      <li><a href="example3.html">Example 3: Using multiple instances of aria-describedby</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>A pass is defined as a radio button that is announced with:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The form control label: <em>"Yes"</em></li>
      <li>The parent legend: <em>"Mould"</em></li>
      <li>The overall question: <em>"Does your house have any of the following problems"</em></li>
    </ol>
